Welcome to my repo homepage! I'm glad you're here. My name is Adriano Interaminense and I've been working in the field of web development for many years and I absolutely love what I do.

On this homepage, you'll find a selection of some of the projects I've worked on over the years. To help you find specific projects, I've included tags for each one. Just click on a tag to see all the projects that relate to it.

In addition to the projects, you'll also find a brief description about myself and my background in web development. I hope this gives you a sense of who I am and what I'm passionate about.

One fun feature of this homepage is the Easter egg that allows you to toggle between dark/light mode. Just click on the moon icon in the top right corner to switch between the two.

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and getting to know a little bit about me. If you have any questions or just want to connect, feel free to reach out via my contact information on the homepage or here on github. See ya!

Soon I will show how you can use my website to create your own and with administration interface!
